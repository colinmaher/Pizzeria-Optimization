Or alternatively, download and extract the github repo and run index.html in your browser.

To optimize this index.html I:


  -Inlined CSS
  
  -Added async to scripts
  
  -Moved inline JS to after end body tag
  
  -Optimized images by reducing their file size
  
  -Added a media attribute to print.css
  
  -Removed unnecessary web font

To optimize pizza.html I:

-changed the page so that instead of putting a set number of sliding pizzas on the page, the number of pizzas on the page is determined by the dimensions of the page.
-I also changed it so that instead of updating the DOM many times in a loop, the DOM is updated once with all the sliding pizzas
